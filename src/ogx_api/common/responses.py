# This is a short term solution to allow inference API to return metrics
# The ideal way to do this is to have a way for all response types to include metrics
# and all metric events logged to the telemetry API to be included with the response
# To do this, we will need to augment all response types with a metrics field.
# We have hit a blocker from stainless SDK that prevents us from doing this.
# The blocker is that if we were to augment the response types that have a data field
# in them like so

# The client SDK will need to access the data by using a .data field, which is not
# ergonomic. Stainless SDK does support unwrapping the response type, but it
# requires that the response type to only have a single field.

# We will need a way in the client SDK to signal that the metrics are needed
# and if they are needed, the client SDK has to return the full response type
# without unwrapping it.

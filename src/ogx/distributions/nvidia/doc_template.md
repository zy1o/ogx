# NVIDIA Distribution

The `ogx/distribution-{{ name }}` distribution consists of the following provider configurations.

{{ providers_table }}{% if run_config_env_vars %}

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured:
{% for var, (default_value, description) in run_config_env_vars.items() %}

- `{{ var }}`: {{ description }} (default: `{{ default_value }}`)
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% if default_models %}

## Models

The following models are available by default:
{% for model in default_models %}

- `{{ model.model_id }} {{ model.doc_string }}`
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## Prerequisites

### NVIDIA API Keys

Make sure you have access to a NVIDIA API Key. You can get one by visiting [https://build.nvidia.com/](https://build.nvidia.com/). Use this key for the `NVIDIA_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Deploy NeMo Microservices Platform

The NVIDIA NeMo microservices platform supports end-to-end microservice deployment of a complete AI flywheel on your Kubernetes cluster through the NeMo Microservices Helm Chart. Please reference the [NVIDIA NeMo Microservices documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/microservices/latest/about/index.html) for platform prerequisites and instructions to install and deploy the platform.

## Supported Services

Each OGX API corresponds to a specific NeMo microservice. The core microservices (Customizer, Evaluator) are exposed by the same endpoint. The platform components (Data Store) are each exposed by separate endpoints.

### Inference: NVIDIA NIM

NVIDIA NIM is used for running inference with registered models. There are two ways to access NVIDIA NIMs:

  1. Hosted (default): Preview APIs hosted at <https://integrate.api.nvidia.com> (Requires an API key)
  2. Self-hosted: NVIDIA NIMs that run on your own infrastructure.

The deployed platform includes the NIM Proxy microservice, which is the service that provides to access your NIMs (for example, to run inference on a model). Set the `NVIDIA_BASE_URL` environment variable to use your NVIDIA NIM Proxy deployment.

### Datasetio API: NeMo Data Store

The NeMo Data Store microservice serves as the default file storage solution for the NeMo microservices platform. It exposts APIs compatible with the Hugging Face Hub client (`HfApi`), so you can use the client to interact with Data Store. The `NVIDIA_DATASETS_URL` environment variable should point to your NeMo Data Store endpoint.

See the [NVIDIA Datasetio docs](https://github.com/ogx-ai/ogx/blob/main/ogx/providers/remote/datasetio/nvidia/README.md) for supported features and example usage.

### Eval API: NeMo Evaluator

The NeMo Evaluator microservice supports evaluation of LLMs. Launching an Evaluation job with NeMo Evaluator requires an Evaluation Config (an object that contains metadata needed by the job). A OGX Benchmark maps to an Evaluation Config, so registering a Benchmark creates an Evaluation Config in NeMo Evaluator. The `NVIDIA_EVALUATOR_URL` environment variable should point to your NeMo Microservices endpoint.

See the [NVIDIA Eval docs](https://github.com/ogx-ai/ogx/blob/main/ogx/providers/remote/eval/nvidia/README.md) for supported features and example usage.

## Deploying models

In order to use a registered model with the OGX APIs, ensure the corresponding NIM is deployed to your environment. For example, you can use the NIM Proxy microservice to deploy `meta/llama-3.2-1b-instruct`.

Note: For improved inference speeds, we need to use NIM with `fast_outlines` guided decoding system (specified in the request body). This is the default if you deployed the platform with the NeMo Microservices Helm Chart.

```sh
# URL to NeMo NIM Proxy service
export NEMO_URL="http://nemo.test"

curl --location "$NEMO_URL/v1/deployment/model-deployments" \
   -H 'accept: application/json' \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -d '{
      "name": "llama-3.2-1b-instruct",
      "namespace": "meta",
      "config": {
         "model": "meta/llama-3.2-1b-instruct",
         "nim_deployment": {
            "image_name": "nvcr.io/nim/meta/llama-3.2-1b-instruct",
            "image_tag": "1.8.3",
            "pvc_size": "25Gi",
            "gpu": 1,
            "additional_envs": {
               "NIM_GUIDED_DECODING_BACKEND": "fast_outlines"
            }
         }
      }
   }'
```

This NIM deployment should take approximately 10 minutes to go live. [See the docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/microservices/latest/get-started/tutorials/deploy-nims.html) for more information on how to deploy a NIM and verify it's available for inference.

You can also remove a deployed NIM to free up GPU resources, if needed.

```sh
export NEMO_URL="http://nemo.test"

curl -X DELETE "$NEMO_URL/v1/deployment/model-deployments/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct"
```

## Running OGX with NVIDIA

You can do this via venv (build code), or Docker which has a pre-built image.

### Via Docker

This method allows you to get started quickly without having to build the distribution code.

```bash
OGX_PORT=8321
docker run \
  -it \
  --pull always \
  -p $OGX_PORT:$OGX_PORT \
  -v ~/.ogx:/root/.ogx \
  -e NVIDIA_API_KEY=$NVIDIA_API_KEY \
  ogx/distribution-{{ name }} \
  --port $OGX_PORT
```

### Via Docker with Custom Run Configuration

You can also run the Docker container with a custom run configuration file by mounting it into the container:

```bash
# Set the path to your custom config.yaml file
CUSTOM_RUN_CONFIG=/path/to/your/custom-config.yaml
OGX_PORT=8321

docker run \
  -it \
  --pull always \
  -p $OGX_PORT:$OGX_PORT \
  -v ~/.ogx:/root/.ogx \
  -v $CUSTOM_RUN_CONFIG:/app/custom-config.yaml \
  -e RUN_CONFIG_PATH=/app/custom-config.yaml \
  -e NVIDIA_API_KEY=$NVIDIA_API_KEY \
  ogx/distribution-{{ name }} \
  --port $OGX_PORT
```

**Note**: The run configuration must be mounted into the container before it can be used. The `-v` flag mounts your local file into the container, and the `RUN_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable tells the entrypoint script which configuration to use.

{% if run_configs %}
Available run configurations for this distribution:
{% for config in run_configs %}

- `{{ config }}`
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

### Via venv

If you've set up your local development environment, you can also install the distribution dependencies using your local virtual environment.

```bash
INFERENCE_MODEL=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
ogx list-deps nvidia | xargs -L1 uv pip install
NVIDIA_API_KEY=$NVIDIA_API_KEY \
INFERENCE_MODEL=$INFERENCE_MODEL \
ogx stack run ./config.yaml \
  --port 8321
```

## Example Notebooks

For examples of how to use the NVIDIA Distribution to run inference and evaluation workloads, you can reference the example notebooks in [docs/notebooks/nvidia](https://github.com/ogx-ai/ogx/tree/main/docs/notebooks/nvidia).

# core

Server core for OGX: routing, provider resolution, storage, and the FastAPI server.

## Request Lifecycle

1. `server.py` receives an HTTP request and dispatches to the correct handler.
2. The handler calls a **Router** (e.g., `InferenceRouter`) which consults the **RoutingTable** to find the provider for the requested resource.
3. The router delegates to the provider implementation.
4. The provider either computes locally (inline) or calls an external service (remote).

## Key Classes

- `Stack` (`stack.py`) -- Orchestrates initialization: loads config, resolves providers, registers resources, starts background tasks.
- `resolve_impls()` (`resolver.py`) -- The provider resolution engine. Validates providers against the registry, sorts by dependency order, instantiates each one.
- `CommonRoutingTableImpl` (`routing_tables/common.py`) -- Base class for all routing tables. Manages the mapping from resource identifiers to provider implementations.
- `DistributionRegistry` (`store/`) -- Persistent registry of all resources (models, vector stores, tool groups, etc.) across providers.

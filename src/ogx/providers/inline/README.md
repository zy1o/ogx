# inline providers

In-process provider implementations that run locally within the OGX server.

## What Makes a Provider "Inline"

Inline providers run in the same process as the server. They are declared with `InlineProviderSpec` and their `provider_type` starts with `inline::` (e.g., `inline::meta-reference`).

Their factory function is typically named `get_provider_impl()` and returns an instance implementing the relevant protocol from `ogx_api`.

## Key Inline Providers

- **`responses/builtin`** -- Implements the OpenAI Responses API. Handles tool calling loops, multi-turn conversations, and streaming.
- **`inference/sentence_transformers`** -- Runs embedding models using the sentence-transformers library.
- **`inference/transformers`** -- Runs Llama models locally using the transformers library.
- **`vector_io/sqlite_vec`** -- SQLite-based vector storage using the sqlite-vec extension.

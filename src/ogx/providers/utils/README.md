## Key Components

### OpenAI Mixin (`inference/openai_mixin.py`)

`OpenAIMixin` is the most important shared utility. It provides a standard implementation of OpenAI-compatible endpoints (chat completion, completion, embeddings) using the `AsyncOpenAI` client. Most remote inference providers extend this mixin and only need to implement `get_base_url()` and optionally customize behavior via class attributes.

### Model Registry (`inference/model_registry.py`)

`ModelRegistryHelper` manages the mapping between OGX model identifiers and provider-specific model IDs. Providers declare their supported models as `ProviderModelEntry` objects.

### Prompt Adapter (`inference/prompt_adapter.py`)

Converts between OGX's message format and provider-specific formats. Handles image content localization, tool call formatting, and other provider-specific adaptations.

### MCP Client (`tools/mcp.py`)

Model Context Protocol client used by tool runtime providers to connect to MCP servers.

### Responses Store (`responses/responses_store.py`)

Persistent storage for OpenAI Responses API objects, used by the agents provider.

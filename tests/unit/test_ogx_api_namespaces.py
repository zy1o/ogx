Contract tests for the ogx_api public surface.

These tests lock in the two-namespace split documented in
`docs/docs/concepts/apis/api_leveling.mdx`:

- `ogx_api.provider.*` exposes the Provider SDK surface (protocol classes,
  ProviderSpec family, schema utilities, Api enum, Resource base classes,
  version constants, validators, and shared resource/value types).
- `ogx_api.types.*` exposes the API datatype surface (request/response
  Pydantic models, content types, errors, value types).

Both namespaces remain importable from the top level for backwards
compatibility.
